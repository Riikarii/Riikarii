- 👋 Hi, I’m Ritik!
- 👀 I’m interested in general relativity, black holes, pulsars, and various other astrophysical objects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to apply programming skills I have acquired through my minor towards research in astrophysics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simulations of the cosmic microwave background radiation, graphing astrophysical trends, and any other physics projects.
- 📫 You can reach me at ritik.kothari@mail.utoronto.ca.
